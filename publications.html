Motion vectors are assigned to non-convex homogeneous clusters characterizing direction, size and shape of regions with multiple independent activities. The proposed method is based on Support Vector Clustering (SVC). Cluster labels are propagated over time via incremental learning. The proposed method uses a kernel function that maps the input motion vectors into a highdimensional space to produce non-convex clusters. We improve the mapping effectiveness by quantifying feature similarities via a blend of position and orientation affinities. We use the Quasiconformal Kernel Transformation to boost the discrimination of outliers. The temporal propagation of the clustersâ€™ identities is achieved via incremental learning based on the concept of feature obsolescence to deal with appearing and disappearing features. Moreover, we design an on-line clustering performance prediction algorithm used as a feedback (closed-loop) that refines the cluster model at each frame in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic datasets and real-world crowded videos, and show that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art approaches</font></em>, <a target="_blank" href="./files/papers/journals/2016_CSVT_SupportVectorMotionClustering_LawalPoiesiAnguitaCavallaro.pdf">pdf</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrea/svmc.html">website</a>

We propose a gradient-climbing technique and an isocontour slicing approach for intensity maps to localize targets. The former uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo to iteratively fit a shape model onto the target locations, whereas the latter uses the intensity values at different levels to find consistent object shapes. We generate trajectories by recursively associating detections with a hierarchical graph-based tracker on temporal windows. The solution to the graph is obtained with a greedy algorithm that accounts for false positive associations. The edges of the graph are weighted with a likelihood function based on location information.

The proposed method infers the direction of movement by calculating prediction lines from displacement vectors and temporally accumulates intersecting locations generated by prediction lines.

The measures take into account target-size variations, combine accuracy and cardinality errors, quantify long-term tracking accuracy at different accuracy levels, and evaluate ID changes relative to the duration of the track in which they occur.

The proposed tracker is based on particle filtering and automatically initializes tracks. The main novelty is the inclusion of the target ID into the particle state, enabling the algorithm to deal with unknown and large number of targets. To overcome the problem of mixing IDs of targets close to each other, we propose a probabilistic model of target birth and death based on a Markov Random Field applied to the particle IDs. Each particle ID is managed using the information carried by neighboring particles. The assignment of the IDs to the targets is performed using Mean-Shift clustering and supported by a Gaussian Mixture Model. We also show that the computational complexity of MT-TBD is proportional only to the number of particles. To compare our method with recent state-of-the-art works, we include a postprocessing stage suited for multi-person tracking.

We define a generic flow diagram that we use to discuss and compare the main stages of multi-target trackers, namely feature extraction, target prediction, localization or association, and post-processing.

Three-dimensional content is starting to become commonplace now in many applications. Although for many years 3D technologies have been used in the generation of assets by researchers and experts, nowadays these tools are starting to become commercially available to every citizen. This is especially the case for smartphones, that are powerful enough and sufficiently widespread to perform a huge variety of activities (e.g. paying, calling, communication, photography, navigation, localization, etc.), including just very recently the possibility of running 3D reconstruction pipelines. The REPLICATE project is tackling this particular issue, and it has an ambitious vision to enable ubiquitous 3D creativity via the development of tools for mobile 3D-assets generation on smartphones/tablets. This article presents the REPLICATE project's concept and some of the ongoing activities, with particular attention being paid to advances made in the first year of work. Thus the article focuses on the system architecture definition, selection of optimal frames for 3D cloud reconstruction, automated generation of sparse and dense point clouds, mesh modelling techniques and post-processing actions. Experiments so far were concentrated on indoor objects and some simple heritage artefacts, however, in the long term we will be targeting a larger variety of scenarios and communities</font></em>, <a target="_blank" href="./files/papers/conferences/2017_3DARCH_Smartphone3DpipelineREPLICATE.pdf">pdf</a>

Finally, we perform sampling by considering the perspective distortion in the target observations. The proposed tracker runs on average at 12 frames per second.

First, we estimate the optical flow and compensate the global camera motion. Then we detect incoming objects while removing the noise caused by dynamic textures, nearby terrain and lens distortion by means of an adaptively learnt background-motion model. Next, we estimate the time to contact, namely the expected time for an incoming object to cross the infinite plane defined by the extension of the image plane. Finally, we combine the time to contact and the compensated motion in a Bayesian framework to identify an object-free region the robot can move towards to avoid the collision.

The flight direction of each camera is inferred via geometric derivation, and the formation is maintained by employing a distributed algorithm that uses the information of the target position on the camera plane and the position of neighboring flying cameras.

                  <div id="disapp_menu"><u>Abstract</u><em> <font color="gray"> - Quadcopters are highly maneuverable and can provide an effective means for an agile dynamic positioning of sensors such as cameras. In this paper we propose a method for the self-positioning of a team of camera-equipped quadcopters (flying cameras) around a moving target. The self-positioning task is driven by the maximization of the monitored surface of the moving target based on a dynamic flight model combined with a collision avoidance algorithm. Each flying camera only knows the relative distance of neighboring flying cameras and its desired position with respect to the target. Given a team of up to 12 flying cameras, we show they can achieve a stable time-varying formation around a moving target without collisions</font></em>, <a target="_blank" href="./files/papers/conferences/2015_ISSNIP_SelfPositioningTeamFlyingCameras_Poiesi_Cavallaro.pdf">pdf</a>, <a target="_blank" href="./files/presentations/presentation_issnip_2015.pdf">slides</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6ZX3czVTbk">video</a>

                  <div id="disapp_menu"><u>Abstract</u><em> <font color="gray"> - Multi-target tracking is the process that allows the extraction of object motion patterns of interest from a scene. Motion patterns are often described through metadata representing object locations and shape information. In the first part of this thesis we discuss the state-of-the-art methods aimed at accomplishing this task on monocular views and also analyse the methods for evaluating their performance. The second part of the thesis describes our research contribution to these topics.<br>
                      We begin presenting a method for multi-target tracking based on track-before-detect (MT- TBD) formulated as a particle filter. The novelty involves the inclusion of the target identity (ID) into the particle state, which enables the algorithm to deal with an unknown and unlimited number of targets. We propose a probabilistic model of particle birth and death based on Markov Random Fields. This model allows us to overcome the problem of the mixing of IDs of close targets.<br>
                      We then propose three evaluation measures that take into account target-size variations, combine accuracy and cardinality errors, quantify long-term tracking accuracy at different accuracy levels, and evaluate ID changes relative to the duration of the track in which they occur. This set of measures does not require pre-setting of parameters and allows one to holistically evaluate tracking performance in an application-independent manner.<br>
                      Lastly, we present a framework for multi-target localisation applied on scenes with a high density of compact objects. Candidate target locations are initially generated by extracting object features from intensity maps using an iterative method based on a gradient-climbing technique and an isocontour slicing approach. A graph-based data association method for multi-target tracking is then applied to link valid candidate target locations over time and to discard those which are spurious. This method can deal with point targets having indistinguishable appearance and unpredictable motion.<br>
                      MT-TBD is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods on real-world surveillance datasets (static and moving cameras) by using the proposed evaluation measures. In the case of online applications the inclusion of the ID in the particle state is effective, but it does not allow the proposed tracker to outperform offline trackers. The proposed measures are compared with existing measures for multi-target tracking and it is shown that the proposed ones comparatively maintain a reliable evaluation of the performance without prior knowledge about the application. The tracking of point targets in high-density scenes is evaluated on datasets containing insects and compared with MT-TBD and alternative multi-target trackers. The proposed solutions achieved the best results, especially in terms of ID maintenance on the targets</font></em>, <a target="_blank" href="https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/8848">pdf</a>

                  <div id="disapp_menu"><u>Abstract</u><em> <font color="gray"> - We present a technique for estimating the location of the ball during a basketball game without using a detector based on appearance features. The methods present in the state-of-the-art which aim to retrieve the ball, generally estimate the position of it using spatial features such as color, shape and size. Moreover, several approaches perform an additional temporal smoothing to filter out incorrect estimates. These methods are dependent upon the initial detection phase, which is based on the extraction of the visual features that not reliable because the ball is frequently occluded and similar to the background. Unlike existing approaches, instead of using visual features associated to the ball, we estimate the ball candidates based on the location of the players and their motion during attack actions. Hence, we propose an approach for ball localization that uses contextual information, i.e. players' bahavior, to estimate the approximate location of the ball. By this way this technique allows us to overcome the challenges due to frequent occlusions of the ball and its similarity in the appearance with the background. Based on this assumption, we use expected dynamics of the game and motion flow to estimate regions of the convergence of the players and the most probable region for the ball location. So, the most probable candidates for the ball location are extracted for each frame. Temporal consistency is then validated using the Kalman filter. Finally, we test the proposed approach on a real basketball scenario, where the ball is most of the time either partially of completely occluded. Experimental results show that the location of the ball can be estimated with an average accuracy of 82.6%</font></em>

                  <div id="disapp_menu"><u>Abstract</u><em> <font color="gray"> - The large amount of multimedia content requires systems capable of automatically manage these data. Therefore, there is the necessity of summarising videos in order to quickly access to the desired content. There exist two methods for the automatic video summarisation. The first is a static summarsation, the second is a dynamic summarisation. The former uses key-frames, the latter uses short video clips (shots) to present the most informative content.<br>
                  In this thesis the summarisation is dynamic and assumed to be done upstream. We propose two systems for the generation of the output video. The first method is offline and can produce either high and low quality videos. High quality videos require a full re-encoding of the shots. The second method is online and is performed with Video Lan via Java interface.<br>
                  Experiments show that the offline process produces a more pleasant summary at a cost of a longer processing time.
